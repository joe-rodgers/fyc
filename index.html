      <h1>FYC.WTF</h1>
        <p>KYC.WTF is a voucher service that works with customers to deliver Bitcoin on their terms. Our approach is simple, keep it simple <b>and</b> private.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Azteco is fast</strong> // Topping up with Azteco takes only a few seconds both to issue and redeem a voucher.</li>
          <li><strong>Azteco is simple</strong> // No account is needed to redeem an Azteco Voucher. Everyone already knows how to use it!</li>
          <li><strong>Azteco is safe</strong> // Azteco doesn't have user accounts, just like Pay as You Go SIM Cards. It's "disposable Bitcoin" for small amounts.</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Bitcoin changes everything.</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin is a secure and safe way to send money to anyone anywhere in the world instantly. It completely eliminates payer fraud. All you need is a wallet and you can immediately start sending and receiving payments from anywhere world-wide, without waiting, without forms to fill, without fees to receive, and no middle man.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin is to money as email is to hand-written post cards on paper sent by post. Bitcoin completely simplifies and greatly speeds up how you send money to other people, and Azteco makes getting Bitcoin easy. </p>
